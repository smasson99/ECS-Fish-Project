# ECS-Fish-Project

This is a school made project wich must show an example of a Unity Project coded in C# using 
the ECS component system. Our goal is to have hundreds of fishes all independent from each 
other. This will show how strong ECS can be in Unity and also how components must be programmed 
as Unity intended when implementing it.
